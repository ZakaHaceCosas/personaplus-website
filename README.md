# PersonaPlus Website

Website for the [PersonaPlus](https://github.com/ZakaHaceCosas/personaplus) project, a health & wellbeing app in React Native & Expo.

Website powered by Vercel.

## Stuff TO-DO

- [ ] Translating.
- [x] Add remaining images and content.
- [x] Optimize images with `.webp` format.
- [x] Optimize CSS as much as possible.
- [x] Fix responsive design (it works, but poorly).
- [x] Perhaps replace some text buttons with icons?
- [x] Make the page static with Astro so no tons of JS are sent to the browser.
- [ ] Add an Astro blog (yes).
